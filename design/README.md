## Building your project

This exercise involves a lot of planning and comminication.

### General Workflow

1. Work in a team of 4 or 5
2. You will have only one repository per team
3. Split up in groups of 2 to work effectively in pair programming
4. Use a git workflow with branches to create this group project
5. You can use the VSCode extension `live-share` to share the sreen
6. If you work in pair programming, switch who codes after 5-10 minutes

### Building process

1. Identify the components in the design
2. Only work on one component per pair per time
   - For example: Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville are in a team. After they identified all the components of the page, they split up in pairs. Ron and Harry work on the header on a branch `app-header` while Hermione and Neville work on a card on a branch `card`. After Ron and Harry are done, they create a pull request and _only_ merge their branch into `main` after a code review from Hermione and Neville. Now Hermione and Neville merge the updated `main` branch into their branch. Harry and Ron start a new component.
3. Build the component in storybook first, then add it to the index.html

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. To use them, place them in the `assets` folder in `src`.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

You'll find the text in the `/content.md` file.
